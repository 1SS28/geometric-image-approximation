# Geometric Image Approximation

## Goal

Reconstruct a raster image using only geometric primitives and mathematical
optimization, without generative AI or learned models.

The objective is to create a beautiful algorithm while preserving as much of math's beauty as possible.

I find geometry particularly interesting so this project will also serve as a good learning opportunity.

Given a target image I, find a set of geometric primitives theta such that:

    minimize L(I, R(theta))

where R(theta) is the image produced by rendering the primitives.

## Initial Constraints

- Start with triangles only
- No AI / ML
- Minimal reliance on computer vision libraries
- Implement optimization and geometric operations manually
- Input: raster image
- Output:
  - reconstructed image
  - list of geometric primitives
  - reconstruction error

## Triangle Representation

Each triangle:

T = (x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, r, g, b, alpha)

Parameters:
- 6 geometric parameters
- 3 color parameters
- 1 opacity parameter

## Initial Algorithm

1. Load target image
2. Initialize canvas to target's mean color
3. Calculate residual error

       E(x,y) = I(x,y) - R(x,y)

4. Select a high-error region
5. Initialize a triangle in that region
6. Optimize:
   - vertices
   - color
   - opacity
7. Add triangle to reconstruction
8. Repeat until N triangles or convergence


## Optimization

Start:
- coordinate descent
- finite-difference gradients

Later investigate:
- simulated annealing
- alternative initialization strategies
- analytical solutions for color / opacity
- global re-optimization

## Questions to Investigate

- How should the next primitive be initialized?
- Can optimal color be solved analytically?
- How should triangle size depend on local error?
- When should optimization stop?
- Is it better to add new triangles or re-optimize old ones?
- How does reconstruction error scale with primitive count?
- Are mixed primitives more efficient than triangles alone?
